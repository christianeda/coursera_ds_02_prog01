The age variable has a high percentage of NA's. Experiment with filling in those values.

I've extracted the title names. I'll work to add age based on the average of each title.

The file cleanTrain.csv has cleaned data and includes ages for all passengers.

My 1st submission was just women & children (under age 18). That got me to 0.73206.

Try running model using only pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch & fare.
